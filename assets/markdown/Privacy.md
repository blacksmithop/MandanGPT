Last Updated: May 10, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how MandanGPT ("the Bot"), a Discord bot, collects, uses, and protects information when you interact with it on Discord. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1. No Direct Collection of Personal Information
The Bot does not directly collect or store any personal information, such as your name, email address, or other identifiable data, unless explicitly provided by you through commands or interactions.

### 1.2. Command Usage Logs
For debugging and improving the Bot’s functionality, we log command usage data. These logs may include:
- The command executed.
- The server (guild) ID where the command was used.
- The timestamp of the command execution.

These logs do not contain personally identifiable information unless you include such information in the command itself. **Users are strongly advised not to pass sensitive or personal information to the Bot through commands or messages.**

### 1.3. Usage Metrics
We collect anonymous usage metrics to understand how the Bot is used and to improve its performance. These metrics include:
- Number of commands executed.
- Types of commands used.
- General Bot activity levels.

These metrics are aggregated and do not contain any identifiable user information.

## 2. How We Use the Information

The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:
- **Debugging and Maintenance**: Command usage logs help us identify and fix issues with the Bot’s functionality.
- **Improving the Bot**: Anonymous usage metrics allow us to analyze trends and enhance the Bot’s features and performance.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, or disclose any data collected by the Bot to third parties, except in the following cases:
- **Legal Requirements**: If required by law or to comply with legal processes, we may disclose data to relevant authorities.
- **Service Providers**: We may use third-party services (e.g., hosting or analytics providers) to operate the Bot. These providers are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and only process data on our behalf.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

- **Storage**: Command usage logs are stored securely and retained only for as long as necessary for debugging purposes, typically no longer than [specify retention period, e.g., 30 days].
- **Security**: We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 5. User Responsibilities

To protect your privacy, please follow these guidelines:
- **Avoid Sharing Sensitive Information**: Do not include personal or sensitive information (e.g., passwords, addresses, or financial details) in commands or messages sent to the Bot.
- **Review Server Settings**: Ensure that the Discord server’s privacy settings align with your preferences, as the Bot operates within the permissions granted by the server administrators.

## 6. Your Rights

Since the Bot does not collect personal information, there is no personal data to access, correct, or delete. If you have concerns about the data we collect, please contact us as outlined in Section 8.
